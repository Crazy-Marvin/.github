- Default branch is ```development``` and buildable branch is ```trunk```
- CI/CD using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Translations on [Hosted Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/) (2 apps are on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/))
- Application monitoring and error tracking with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) or [Firebase Crashlytics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_mdNRZzd30) on some apps, but most of them run __without__ them to be privacy-friendly
- Vulnerabilities are searched by [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/features/security)
- The preferred databases are [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), [MySQL](https://mariadb.org/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) although a few apps use [Firebase Realtime Database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5aeM5dvUpA)
