## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?  
Crazy Marvin is a collective of opensourcers that create chatbots and apps for many platforms. We use classical and heroic languages like Java, Javascript and C plus newcomers like Flutter and Kotlin plus fancy frameworks like Vue.

Most designs follow the latest Material guidelines but we have some retro styles too.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?    
There is a CONTRIBUTING.md in almost every repository. If it is not or needs improved, please open a PR for that.

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?    
Most of it should be in the README.md, SETUP.md or CONTRIBUTING.md. Please let us know if something is missing.

🍿 Fun facts   
Most of our code has bugs, no tests and security issues.

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)   
Yes, Markdown is awesome!
